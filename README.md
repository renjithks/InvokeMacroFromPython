# InvokeMacroFromPython
Here is an example of Python code that uses the win32com library to invoke an Excel VBA macro

In this example, the code first imports the win32com library and creates a new instance of the Excel Application object. It then opens the workbook that contains the macro using the Workbooks.Open method and specifies the path to the workbook file. The macro is invoked using the Application.Run method and passing the name of the module and the macro name separated by a dot. The workbook is saved and closed and then the excel application is quit.

Please keep in mind that you need to have Microsoft Office installed on your machine to be able to use this library and you should replace the path and the module name and macro name with the appropriate values for your case.

Also, you should be careful when automating Excel, as it can cause unexpected behavior or even crash the program if not handled properly.
